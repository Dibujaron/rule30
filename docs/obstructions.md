# Obstructions

Known dead ends, one per entry: the claim someone would naturally try, why
it fails, and what it would take. Read by theorist and seeder sessions
before they propose anything. Maintained by Rowan and by theorists, who
may append an entry and may correct a factual error in one; an obstruction
that has been overcome is never rewritten or removed, it gets a new entry
saying so and citing the sha that opened the route.

Every entry has the same four parts, so a reader can skim the first two
and stop.

## The diagonal structure never reaches the centre column

**The natural attempt.** Every left diagonal is eventually periodic with a
known period bound (`leftDiagonal_periodicFrom_pow`, and after
`leftDiagonal_step_period_dichotomy` a criterion for when the period grows).
The centre column is made of one cell from each left diagonal, so use the
periodic structure of the diagonals to say something about the centre
column.

**Why it fails.** The centre cell at time `t` is `leftDiagonal t 0`: index
zero of diagonal `t`. A diagonal is periodic only from its onset, and the
onset is at least one for every diagonal past the third (computed, not
proved: `leftDiagonal_onset_le` is still a wall), so index zero is
in the transient of every diagonal it belongs to. The same holds for the
right diagonals: `rightDiagonal t 0` is again the centre cell, at the start
of that diagonal. Every diagonal theorem on the board is about the part of
the picture that has settled; P1 is a question about the part that has not.
Time runs down the picture, and the diagonals settle from the outside in,
so the centre column is exactly the seam where nothing has settled yet.

**What it would take.** A statement about the transients: the cells of
diagonal `k` before its onset, as a function of `k`. Nothing on the board
or in the literature says anything about them beyond the onset bound
`2 ^ k` and the measured onset near `k / 2`. A theorem of the shape "the
first cell of every left diagonal is determined by the transients of the
two diagonals above it and by its own previous cell" is true by
`leftDiagonal_recurrence` and says nothing, because that previous cell at
index zero is the centre cell itself: the recurrence closes on the very
cell it was meant to explain, and the transients of the two diagonals
above are themselves unknown.

## The centre column as a boundary condition

**The natural attempt.** Each cell at `x ≥ 1` reads only cells at
`x - 1, x, x + 1 ≥ 0` one step earlier, so the strip of columns `x ≥ 1`,
started all white, is a deterministic function of the centre column alone;
the same holds for `x ≤ -1`. So state the residual about that half-line
automaton: "a periodic boundary sequence gives an aperiodic column 1", and
prove it about sequences, forgetting that the boundary is the centre of
the single seed.

**Why it fails.** The statement about sequences is false. For the boundary
`b ≡ true` the right half-line reads, in columns 1, 2, 3, …:
`000…, 100…, 010…, 011…, 0101…, 01011…, 010101…`, and once column 1 is
white and column 2 black they stay so (`1 xor (0 || 1) = 0`,
`0 xor (1 || _) = 1`): columns 1 and 2 are constant from row 2. The left
half-line for the same boundary is constant too (`col(-1) ≡ 0`,
`col(-2) ≡ 1`, alternating outward). The full configuration is
`…1010 1 | 000…`, the `(01)^ℤ` fixed point meeting white, every column
eventually constant, violating nothing: Jen's and Kopra's theorems need a
configuration white far to the left, and this one is not. Hand-checked to
row 6 and closed by the two-line induction, 2026-09-07 (Sextant); script
text in `docs/attacks/2026-09-07-centercolumn-other-iseventuallyperiodic-of-center.md`.

**What it would take.** Any proof of the residual must carry the white
cone on the left into the argument: the pair `(column 0, column 1)`
solved leftward by `evolve_sub_one_eq_xor` must be white outside the cone
and black on its edge. That is exactly what closes the width-2 case, and
at width 1 the sideways inverse has a free input at every time the centre
is black, so nothing propagates. A statement about the centre column that
does not mention the left cone, however plausible, cannot be the lemma
that closes this wall.
