# Seed statements

Captain-authored lemmas for the dispatcher to hand out. Every theorem here is
`sorry` on purpose: this file states, `Rule30/Proofs/` proves. A worker never
imports this file; the harness checks a worker's proof against the statement
here with a `type_of%` check theorem, so the two never share a name.

Regions: `P1` is the geometry of the light cone and its edges, where
periodicity provably holds; `P2` is the density bookkeeping behind the
balance conjecture. P3 gets nothing here on purpose (see `Rule30/Prize.lean`).

/-! ## P1 — the geometry of the cone -/

/-- **Outside the light cone, nothing happens.** After `t` steps every cell
farther than `t` from the origin is still white, because information moves at
most one cell per step and everything started white except the origin.

Induction on `t`; the step case unfolds `evolve_succ` and `rule30_eq` and
uses that all three neighbours were outside the cone one step earlier. -/
theorem evolve_eq_false_of_outside_cone (t : ℕ) (i : ℤ) (h : (t : ℤ) < |i|) :
    evolve t i = false := by
  sorry

/-- **The left edge is always black.** The leftmost cell that can be
non-white after `t` steps is at `-t`, and it is black at every `t`: its left
neighbour and itself were white a step earlier and its right neighbour was
the previous edge, so `xor false (false || true) = true`. -/
theorem evolve_left_edge (t : ℕ) : evolve t (-(t : ℤ)) = true := by
  sorry

/-- **The right edge is always black.** Symmetric in position but not in
argument: at `t`, the previous edge is the *left* neighbour, so the new cell
is `xor true (false || false) = true`. -/
theorem evolve_right_edge (t : ℕ) : evolve t (t : ℤ) = true := by
  sorry

/-- **The second diagonal from the left is all black.** The cell one to the
right of the left edge, at `-t` after `t+1` steps. Its left neighbour was
outside the cone, its own previous value was the left edge (black), so
`xor false (true || _) = true`. -/
theorem evolve_left_second_diagonal (t : ℕ) : evolve (t + 1) (-(t : ℤ)) = true := by
  sorry

/-- **The third diagonal from the left is all white.** The cell two to the
right of the left edge, at `-t` after `t+2` steps: its left neighbour was the
edge (black) and its own previous value was the second diagonal (black), so
`xor true (true || _) = false`. Together with the previous two lemmas this
is the first honest evidence that periodicity lives at the edges of rule 30
and is only conjectured to fail at the centre. -/
theorem evolve_left_third_diagonal (t : ℕ) : evolve (t + 2) (-(t : ℤ)) = false := by
  sorry

/-! ### The diagonal family, chosen by measurement

Write `d k j` for the cell `j` steps along the `k`-th diagonal in from the
left edge — that is, `evolve (j + k) (-j)`. The four lemmas above are `d 0`,
`d 1` and `d 2`, each written out by hand. `explorer/diagonalscan.mjs`
measures the rest of the family, and says the regularity does not stop: over
16000 generations every left diagonal to `k = 63` is periodic with period 1,
2, 4 or 8, and from `k = 18` that period only begins after a short prefix.
The right-hand diagonals are periodic too, but their periods double away —
256 already at `k = 16`, and unchanged when the prefix is made four times
longer — which is the first quantitative handle on rule 30's asymmetry.

That is finite evidence, and finite evidence about an infinite object can
only ever *choose what to state*. It is the proofs below it that would make
any of it true. -/

/-- **The left diagonals satisfy a closed recurrence.** One step of the rule
rewritten in diagonal coordinates: the cell one further along diagonal
`m + 2` is determined by the diagonal two shallower, the diagonal one
shallower, and its own previous term — and by nothing deeper in the cone.

That triangular dependency is the whole reason the left side can be settled
one `k` at a time, and this lemma is the dictionary every later diagonal
proof should cite instead of re-deriving the coordinate shift. Checked
against the engine at every depth to `k = 11` with no mismatches; the proof
is one unfold of `evolve_succ` and `rule30_eq`. -/
theorem evolve_left_diagonal_recurrence (m i : ℕ) :
    evolve (i + m + 3) (-((i : ℤ) + 1))
      = xor (evolve (i + m + 2) (-((i : ℤ) + 2)))
          (evolve (i + m + 2) (-((i : ℤ) + 1)) || evolve (i + m + 2) (-(i : ℤ))) := by
  sorry

/-- **The fourth diagonal from the left alternates.** The first diagonal that
is not constant: black, white, black, white, with no prefix before the
pattern starts. `decide (t % 2 = 0)` is the `Bool` saying whether `t` is
even — the proposition `t % 2 = 0` and the `Bool` that reports it are
different things, and only the `Bool` can be the value of a cell.

This is where the P1 idiom that closed `d 0` to `d 2` — unfold once, discharge
each neighbour with a served lemma — stops being enough on its own: the
recurrence feeds this diagonal its own previous term, so the proof needs an
induction on `t` rather than a single step. -/
theorem evolve_left_fourth_diagonal (t : ℕ) :
    evolve (t + 3) (-(t : ℤ)) = decide (t % 2 = 0) := by
  sorry

/-- **The fifth diagonal from the left is all black.** Constant again, one
step past the alternating one, which is why the family cannot be read off
by extrapolating: the periods measured down the left side run 1, 1, 1, 2, 1,
2, 2, 1, 4, 1, … and do not increase monotonically. -/
theorem evolve_left_fifth_diagonal (t : ℕ) : evolve (t + 4) (-(t : ℤ)) = true := by
  sorry

/-- **The second diagonal from the right alternates**, where the second from
the left was constant black. The two edges of the cone are both black
(`evolve_left_edge`, `evolve_right_edge`), and one cell in they already
disagree. This is the smallest true statement that distinguishes the two
sides of rule 30, and it is the reason the left-hand diagonals stay simple
while the right-hand ones do not. -/
theorem evolve_right_second_diagonal (t : ℕ) :
    evolve (t + 1) (t : ℤ) = decide (t % 2 = 0) := by
  sorry

/-- **The fourth left diagonal is eventually periodic**, in exactly the sense
`Rule30/Prize.lean` means it: `IsEventuallyPeriodic` is the same predicate
that Wolfram's first prize question denies of the centre column.

Nothing here bears on that question — a diagonal at the edge of the cone and
the column down its middle are different sequences, and the whole content of
the conjecture is that the middle one behaves unlike this. What it does is
give the predicate its first inhabited instance in this project, so that
`IsEventuallyPeriodic` is a thing we have used rather than only stated.
Immediate from `evolve_left_fourth_diagonal` with `p = 2` and `N = 0`. -/
theorem evolve_left_fourth_diagonal_isEventuallyPeriodic :
    IsEventuallyPeriodic (fun j => evolve (j + 3) (-(j : ℤ))) := by
  sorry

/-- **Every left diagonal is eventually periodic.** The target the lemmas
above are steps towards, and the first node in this project that is a goal
rather than a step.

This is *not* a prize conjecture and must not be filed as one: it is a claim
about the edge of the cone, where periodicity is already proved for the first
three diagonals, not about the centre. But it is not a small statement
either. The measurement supports it to `k = 63` and no further, the onset
grows with `k`, and a proof needs an argument about all `k` at once — the
recurrence above says diagonal `k` is a function of finitely many shallower
ones, which is the shape such an argument would take, and is not itself
such an argument. Do not dispatch this; decompose it. -/

/-! ## P2 — density bookkeeping -/

/-- The centre column starts black: the initial configuration has exactly one
black cell, at the origin. -/
theorem centerColumn_zero : centerColumn 0 = true := by
  sorry

/-- The density is never negative: it is a count divided by a natural. -/
theorem centerColumnDensity_nonneg (N : ℕ) : 0 ≤ centerColumnDensity N := by
  sorry

/-- The density never exceeds one: the filtered set is a subset of `range N`,
so its cardinality is at most `N`. (At `N = 0` Lean's `0 / 0 = 0`.) -/
theorem centerColumnDensity_le_one (N : ℕ) : centerColumnDensity N ≤ 1 := by
  sorry

/-- **The density recurrence.** Multiplying out the divisions, the count of
black cells among the first `N + 1` equals the count among the first `N`
plus one if cell `N` is black. `Finset.range_succ` and `Finset.filter_insert`
do the work. -/
theorem centerColumnDensity_succ (N : ℕ) :
    centerColumnDensity (N + 1) * ((N + 1 : ℕ) : ℝ) =
      centerColumnDensity N * (N : ℝ) + (if centerColumn N then 1 else 0) := by
  sorry

/-! ## Harness self-test -/

/-- A trivially true statement that exists only so the harness's verifier
tests have something to prove without touching a real node's proof file. It
is deliberately absent from `blueprint/dag.json`. -/
theorem harness_probe : True := by
  sorry
